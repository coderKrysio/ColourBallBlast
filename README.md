# ColourBallBlast

Colour Ball Blast is an online game that can be played directly in a web browser. The game is built around the concept of eliminating colored balls to protect a white shooter from being colored.

The gameplay is simple and easy to understand. The player controls a stationary white shooter at the bottom of the screen that shoots lasers when the player taps in the direction of a colored ball. The shooter does not move, but the player must aim and shoot at the incoming colored balls to match three or more of the same color, which causes them to be eliminated from the game board.

The size of the ball determines how many shots are required to eliminate it. Smaller balls can be eliminated with a single shot, while larger balls require multiple shots.

As the player progresses through the game, the difficulty level increases with more balls being created within shorter intervals of time. The game becomes increasingly challenging as the player must quickly eliminate the incoming balls to prevent the shooter from becoming colored.

Colour Ball Blast does not feature any power-ups. Instead, the game is designed to be challenging and addictive through its increasing difficulty levels and the player's need for quick reflexes and accurate aiming.

Overall, Colour Ball Blast is a fun and engaging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. Its simple controls and intuitive gameplay make it easy to pick up, while its colorful graphics and upbeat music create a lively and engaging atmosphere that will keep players coming back for more.
